# Pacman-Clone
A clone of Pacman made using C++. Raylib is used for rendering and ImGUI is used for debugging tools. Currently includes Pacman movement code and a map. 
I will make a write-up on my [personal website](https://porple.fish/) when I finish all the goals listed below!

## Features
* Rendering done in Raylib
* Debugging tools made in ImGUI, accessible when initializing the game in main()
* Custom art assets done in Aseprite

## Goals
- [x] Grid based movement
- [ ] NPC movement using Pacman style AI
- [ ] NPC movement using A* Pathfinding & state machine logic
- [ ] Pellets, power pellets and fruit
- [ ] Main menu and game loop
